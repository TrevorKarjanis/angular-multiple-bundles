# Multiple Angular Elements

This project demonstrates running two distinct [Angular elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements) in the same page using [@angular-builders/custom-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-builders/custom-webpack). For simplicity of implementation, they look the same, but they are two distinct sources and builds.
